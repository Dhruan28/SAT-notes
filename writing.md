## Subject verb agreement

- Here are the 7 rules for subject and verb agreement

  1. Eliminate prepositional phrases
     - Wherever prepositions are used close to the subjec, eliminate them
  2. Eliminate interrupters
     - Any text between 2 ',' are considered interrupters
  3. Inverted Sentences
     - Invert the syntax of the sentence to make the verb come before the subject
  4. Compound Subjects
     - When 2 nouns are connected by 'and' the subject should be singular
  5. Tricky Singulars
     | List | for | tricky singulars|
     | ------- | ------ | -------- |
     | everybody| someone| somebody|
     | neither | either | everyone |
     | anybody | anything | each |
     | anyone | no one | everything |
     | little | much | none |

  6. Gerunds are Singular

  - Verb + 'ing' are gerunds, these are singular.

  7. Collective nouns are singular

  - Collective nouns refer to groups of people or things, they are singular

### Verb Tenses

- How a verb is conjugated

  - present tense
  - past tense
  - future tense

- **Simple tense**:

  - Most common tense. Used when discussing something that happened yesterday now or will happen tomorrow

- **Progressive tense**:

  - Continuous tense, describing an ongoing action when something else is taking place

- **Perfect tense**:

  - Used to describe many actions that take place over a period of time. In perfect tense, the main verb is always in its past participle
  - **Presnet perfect**
    - Tip offs: FODS(For, Over, During, Since), 'Has'/'Have' with the 3rd form of the verb, for when an action was recently completed
  - **Past Perfect**
    - Tip offs: 2 actions in the past mentioned, sequence of actionis, 'By the time' is used, for an action before a specific time

- **Would**:
  - Would is generally used for sentences in the _past tense_
  1. 'Would' can be used to talk about past habits
  2. 'Would' can be used to talk about the future in the past
  3. 'Would' can be used for hypotheticals

## Modifiers

- Modifiers are words/phrases that elaborate a sentence. It needs to be placed close to the subject for it to take effect. There are 2 types of modifiers:
  - Misplaced Modifiers
  - Dangling Modifiers

### Misplaced Modifiers

- Misplaced Modifiers appear at any point in a sentence. They are made up of modifiers that seperated from the words/phrase they are meant to modify

### Dangling Modifiers

- Dangling Modifiers are introductory phrases which describe the subject but dont mention it. A comma seperates it from the rest of the sentence

## Parallel Structures & Faulty Comparisions

### Parallel Structures

- Parallel Structures is the repition of the same gramatical form in a sentence, maintaining parallel strucure helps maintain gramatical accuracy. Parallel structures are most commonly used in sentences that appear in a list or a pair.

### Parallel Lists

- Avoid mixing forms whe composing a series of verbs, ie. Combing an infinitive withh a gerund destroys a parallel structure

### Faulty comparisions

- When a comparison is incomplete or when items are being compared in different categories. Faulty comparisions are illogical constructions. The idea you mean to convey may not come through

## Pronoun Antecedent

- A pronoun is used to replace nouns. You can refer to nouns by using a pronoun instead of the noun each time.

### Pronoun Types

- There are 7 different pronoun types
  1. **Demonstrative** (this,that,these,those)
  2. Indefintie (anybody,something,many,some,each)
  3. **Emphatic/Reflexive** (yourself,herslef,myslef)
  4. **Interrogative** (who,which,what)
  5. Personal (I,you,he,she,we,they)
  6. Possesive (mine,yours,his,hers,its)
  7. **Relative** (who,whom,whose,which)

### Agreement in Number

- If the antecedent is plural, the pronoun must be plural. Same goes for if the antecedent is singular

### Agreement in Gender

- A pronoun must match its antecedent in gender

### Common Mistakes

- Antecedents with conjunctions
  When singular antecedents are joined by 'and' and its reffered with a plural pronoun

- Common gender singular antecedent
  When it is unclear whether a singular noun refers to a male or female, the term 'his or hers' is used

- Missing or Ambiguous Antecedent
  When the noun that a pronoun refers to is unclear, include the object that the pronoun refers to

# Molecule 7:

## Plurals V Possesives

### General Rule

- Add an 's' to the singular noun form ignoring nouns ending with s,x,ch,sh or z. We usually add 'es' as an ending to those nouns

### Forming Possesives

- Add an 's after the noun to make it a possesive as long as the noun does not end in 's'

### It's V Its

- 'Its' is a possesive form of it
- 'It's' is a contraction of 'it has/is'

### You're V Your

- 'You're' is a contradiction of'you are'
- 'Your' is a possesive form of you

### There/Their/They're

- 'There' is an indicative of place or directioin
- 'Their' is a possesive form of they
- 'They're' is a contraction of they are

### Who's V Whose

- "Who's" is a contraction of who is/has
- 'Whose' is a possesive form of who
